Throughout this semester I found that some of the things I was working on was a big task. Even though I had already ecountered majority of building grids, animations, and basic criteria for building a site. I struggled most with building my grid and making it responsive for when it becomes live. 
In making my protfolio I wanted to give people an inside look of myself, like an outline. So I built my resume out of a stencil in connection of a visual outline on the computer or mobile device of myself. I also like to make a lot of big stencils for major art work for connections of a shadow's of the photograph that was transformed.
